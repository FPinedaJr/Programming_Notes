## Git Basics

**Git:**
- Version control system for tracking code changes.
- Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.

**Key Functions:**
- **Repositories:** Manage projects.
- **Clone:** Create a local copy of a project.
- **Staging and Committing:** Control and track changes.
- **Branch and Merge:** Work on different parts and versions.
- **Pull:** Get the latest project version.
- **Push:** Update the main project with local changes.

## Working with Git
1. **Initialization:**
   - Turn a folder into a Git repository.

2. **File Status:**
   - Files are either unmodified, modified, or staged.

3. **Staging and Committing:**
   - Choose modified files to stage and commit.

4. **History and Reverting:**
   - Git stores a full history; revert to any previous commit.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - Git tracks changes, not separate copies for each commit.

## Why Git?
- Used by over 70% of developers.
- Enables collaboration from anywhere.
- Provides a detailed project history.
- Allows reverting to earlier versions.

## GitHub
- Not the same as Git.
- GitHub uses Git.
- Largest source code host globally.
- Owned by Microsoft since 2018.
- Focus of this tutorial is Git with GitHub.
