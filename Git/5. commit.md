## Committing Changes in Git

To move from the staging to the commit phase and track progress:

1. **Committing Changes:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "commit message"
   ```
   - The `-m "commit message"` adds a clear message to the commit.

   Example:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "First release of Hello World!"
   ```

2. **Git Commit without Stage:**
   - For small changes, commit directly without staging.
   - The `-a` option stages every changed, already tracked file.

   Example:
   ```bash
   git commit -a -m "Updated index.html with a new line"
   ```

   **Note:** Skipping the staging environment is not generally recommended.

3. **Git Commit Log:**
   - View commit history with the `log` command.
   ```bash
   git log
   ```

   **Example Output:**
   ```
   commit c4a5765fb6c9800b0f032a6fe7b3e6e268bea56e (HEAD -> main)
   Author: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
   Date:   Mon Jan 10 12:34:56 2024 +0000

       First release of Hello World!
   ```

   - The log displays commit hash, author, date, and message.

### **Short Git Status:**
```bash
git status --short
>>> 
	M file.ext
```

**Git Status Short Flags:**
- ?? - Untracked files
- A - Files added to stage
- M - Modified files
- D - Deleted files
