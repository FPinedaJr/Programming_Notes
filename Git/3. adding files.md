## Adding Files to a Git Repository

1. **Create a File:**
   - Use your text editor to create a file, e.g., `index.html`.

2. **Move or Save File:**
   - Move or save the file in the Git repository folder.

3. **Check Git Status:**
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   - Git is aware of the file but hasn't added it to the repository.

4. **Understanding File States:**
   - Tracked: Known to Git and added to the repository.
   - Untracked: In your working directory but not added.

Now, to make Git track the file, you need to stage it using:
```bash
git add index.html
```

This puts the file in the staging environment, and you can then commit it to the repository.
