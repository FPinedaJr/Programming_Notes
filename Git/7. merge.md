## Merge Branches

### Merging Changes

1. Switch to the target branch (e.g., master):
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   ```

2. Merge the current branch with the target branch (e.g., emergency-fix):
   ```bash
   git merge emergency-fix
   ```
   - If it's a fast-forward merge, it's completed automatically.
   - If there's a conflict, manual resolution is required.

### Deleting Source Branch

- If the branches are essentially the same after the merge, delete the source branch (e.g., emergency-fix):
   ```bash
   git branch -d emergency-fix
   ```

### Handling Merge Conflicts

1. In case of a conflict during merge:
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git merge branch-name
   ```
   - Resolve conflicts manually in the conflicted file.

2. After resolving conflicts, stage the file:
   ```bash
   git add file.ext
   ```

3. Check the status to ensure conflicts are resolved:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   - All conflicts fixed but still in the merging state.

4. Conclude the merge by committing changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "message"
   ```
   - Note: Use "git commit" to conclude the merge.

### Summary

Successfully merging branches ensures changes are incorporated into the main branch, and conflicts are resolved before finalizing the merge.
