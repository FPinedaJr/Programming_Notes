## Integer or `int`
- int variables can contain any whole number
- int variables are immutable
```python
int1 = 100
int2 = 69
int3 13213612673
print (int1, " if of ", type(int1))
print (int2, " if of ", type(int2))
print (int3, " if of ", type(int3))
```

## Floating point value or `float`
- floats variables can contain any decimal numbers
- float variables are immutable
```python
float1 = 1.11
float2 = 69.69
float3 = 12673578125.987126879126
print (float1, " if of ", type(float1))
print (float2, " if of ", type(float2))
print (float3, " if of ", type(float3))
```

## Texts or `string`
- string variables can contain any word or words
- you have to enclose the texts with 'single' or "doubel" quotes
- you can use the quotes interchangeable like in str3
- there is a more precise version of float called double
- strings are immutable
```python
str1 = "I am a text"
str2 = 'This is the same with text, a string'
str3 = '"821376891372" but its a string, not int'
print (str1, " if of ", type(str1))
print (str2, " if of ", type(str2))
print (str3, " if of ", type(str3))
```



## Booleans or `bool`
- boolean variables can only contain values of true or false
- boolean variable are immutable
```python
bool1 = 2>1
bool2 = 1>2
print(bool1, " ,2>1 and this an example of", type(bool1))
print(bool2, ",1>2 and this an example of", type(bool2))
```

## `list`
- list is a mutable datatype
```python
list1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,"eight","nine",10.01]
list2 = [ 1,   2, 3   ,4     ,5,6,7,"eight","nine",10.01]
print(list1, " is of ", type(list1))
print(list2, " is of ", type(list2))
```

## `tuple`
- tuple is an immutable datatype
```python
tuple1 = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,"eight","nine",10.01)
tuple2 = ( 1,   2, 3   ,4     ,5,6,7,"eight","nine",10.01)
print(tuple1, " is of ", type(tuple1))
print(tuple2, " is of ", type(tuple2))
```


## dictionary or `dict`
- dict or dictionary will store the value in a 'key'
- it is also called as a hashmap
- mutable
```python
dict = {"key":"this will be stored to 'key'","name":"meow","animal":"cat"}
print(dict, " is of ", type(dict))
```

## `set`
- set is a set
- mutable
```python
set1 = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,"eight","nine",10.01}
set2 = { 1,   2, 3   ,4     ,5,6,7,"eight","nine",10.01}
print(set1, " is of ", type(set1))
print(set2, " is of ", type(set2))
```

## `complex`
```python
complex1 = 4 + 3j #4 is the real part while the 3 is the imaginary part hence the 'j'
complex2 = complex(2,3) #it can also be in this format
print(complex1.real, complex1.imag)
print(complex2.real, complex2.imag)
print(complex)
```
