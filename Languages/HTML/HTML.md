the documant structure of HTML consists of:
#### Head 
which contains the metadata. Like:
```html
<head>
	<link rel=sylesheet" href="styles.css" />
	<title>Meow</title>
</head>
```

#### Body
which contains the various tags.


both of these should be enclosed with the `<html></html>` tag.
It should also tart with `<!doctype html>`
