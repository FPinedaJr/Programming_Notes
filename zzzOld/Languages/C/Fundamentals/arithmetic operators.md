- + (addition)
- - (subtraction)
- * (multiplication)
- / (division)
- % (modulus)
- ++ (increment)
- -- (decrement)

**NOTE!** be careful with integer division because it will only output an int if the given are ints.

## augmented assignment operators
- used to replace a statement where an operator takes a variable as one of its arguments and then assigns the result back to the same variable.
- basically its for incrementing and decrementing the value of a specific variable.
- this can be used on all operators: +, -, \*, /, and %

```c
x = x + 69;
x += 69;
```

```c
x = x - 69;
x -= 69;
```

**NOTE!** if you are only incrementing or decrementing by 1, you can use the ++ or -- arithmetic operator respectively.
```c
x = x + 1;
x += 1;
x++;
```

```c
x = x -1;
x -= 1;
x--;
```
