## HTML Paragraphs, Rules, and Line Breaks

HTML `<p>` element defines a paragraph, starting on a new line with automatic white space.
HTML display varies on screens; extra spaces or lines in code won't affect display.

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>  
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
```

### Horizontal Rules

`<hr>` tag creates a horizontal rule for content separation.

```html
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>  
<p>This is some text.</p>  
<hr>  
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>  
<p>This is some other text.</p>  
<hr>
```

### Line Breaks

`<br>` element provides line breaks without starting a new paragraph.

```html
<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>
```

### The Poem Problem

Without `<pre>` element, a poem displays on a single line.

```html
<p>  
  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.  
  My Bonnie lies over the sea.  
  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.  
  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.  
</p>
```

### Solution - The HTML `<pre>` Element

Use `<pre>` to maintain spaces and line breaks in preformatted text.

```html
<pre>  
  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.  
  My Bonnie lies over the sea.  
  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.  
  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.  
</pre>
```
