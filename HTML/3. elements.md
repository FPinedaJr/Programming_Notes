## HTML Element Structure

An HTML element is defined by a start tag, content, and an end tag:
```html
<tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>
```

Some elements, like `<br>`, are empty and do not have an end tag.

### Importance of End Tags

While some HTML elements might display correctly even without the end tag, it is crucial not to skip it:
```html
<html>  
	<body>  
		<p>This is a paragraph</p>
		<p>This is another paragraph</p>
	</body>  
</html>
```
However, relying on this can lead to unexpected results and errors, so it's advised never to skip the end tag.

### Empty HTML Elements

Elements without content are termed empty elements. For instance, the `<br>` tag defines a line break and is an empty element without a closing tag:
```html
<p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>
```

### Case Sensitivity in HTML

HTML tags are not case-sensitive; `<P>` is equivalent to `<p>`. Although the HTML standard doesn't enforce lowercase tags, W3C recommends using lowercase in HTML and mandates it for stricter document types like XHTML.
